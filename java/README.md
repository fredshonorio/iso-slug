# Java implementation

This a basic Java 8 implementation, written under a functional style.
It won't be fast for large strings, but that's a unusual use-case.
Better implementations are welcome.

Relevant methods are `IsoSlug.encode()` and `IsoSlug.decode()`.

Tested with the lovely [junit-quickcheck](https://github.com/pholser/junit-quickcheck).
